# jtdx_pi

These documents may help in you in building JTDX on RaspberryPI. since JTDX.tech has gone down, found it difficult to find a build for RPI 4. Hence found it easier to compile it, well not exactly, too many dependencies, but finally got it working.

My rig

1. RaspberryPI4 8G
2. ICOM 7300
3. HomeBrew 4 band Inverted V (40,20.15,10)
4. MFJ 993b


Hope this helps.
